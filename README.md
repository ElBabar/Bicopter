# Bicopter
My first bicopter

this is a bicopter i'm developping. 

Only person working on it for now.

Currently facing a problem : I need to implement a mechanical low pass filter on the imu before continue working on it, 
as i'm getting all the noise from the motors with any filter I implement.

adding a line for testing purpose
