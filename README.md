# Bicopter
This is a bicopter i'm developping. 

Currently facing a problem : I need to implement a mechanical low pass filter on the imu before I continue working on it, 
as i'm getting all the noise from the motors with any filter I implement.

The working code is in the folder Get_360 for the controller and Hover_Try for the drone.

Code is to be cleaned.
